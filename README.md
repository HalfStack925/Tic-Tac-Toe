# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using Java

The main part of the game was developed by coding along with this tutorial https://youtu.be/rA7tfvpkw0I
I added the feature "Play again", "End game", and "No winner" 

This main use of this project for me was pratice using Java swing elements, as well as using JOption pane to display dialog boxes and trigger functions based on the result
